## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript you'll need for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon


The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.

## Got feedback for me?

I'm always looking to improve our challenges and our platform. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email hongduyen0705[at]gmail[dot]com.

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
